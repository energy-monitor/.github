# Energy Monitor

Here you find the code used for running [https://energie.wifo.ac.at](https://energie.wifo.ac.at). 

Till now two repositories are used:
- [explore](https://github.com/energy-monitor/explore) - Data Wrangling/Analysis Scripts
- [web](https://github.com/energy-monitor/web) - Web Frontend

Note that the [explore](https://github.com/energy-monitor/explore) repository contains a lot more data 
loaders/praperation than needed for the website. The aim of this repo to alleviate/share the effort of 
energy relevated data wrangling. 

Any contribution is welcome!
